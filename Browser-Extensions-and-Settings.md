# Browser

- [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) Chrome without all of Google's data piracy. Ungoogled Chromium comes without the ability to add extensions. Use [Chromium Web Store](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store) to add this.
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) A browser that comes with ad & tracker blocking, and reasonable privacy & security settings. I just turn off "Brave Rewards", "Brave Wallet", and the VPN button.
